      <b>Virtual Vesalius</b> is a medical education venture that seeks to bring stereoscopic-3D 
      virtual and augmented reality experiences to the smartphones of anatomy students, worldwide. 
    </p>

    <p>
      We want to democratize the promise of mixed reality educational experiences to anyone with a smartphone in their pocket. Our plan is to use the Google Cardboard platform, an open-source inexpensive device that allows users to slide their phone inside a cardboard headset to see in true stereoscopic 3D.

    We are Rohit Malyala and Nick Maizlin, residents at the University of British Columbia and Western University. Our experiences in delivering and receiving anatomy education during COVID lockdowns helped us realize the importance of having options for high-quality anatomy education even when access to physical models was not possible.
