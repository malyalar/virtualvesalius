In 1939, Dr. Bassett earned his MD from Stanford University School of Medicine and later became an expert in anatomy and dissection at the University of Washington. He gained prominence for his innovative creation of stereoscopic anatomical images, a series of paired slides utilizing Gruber's View-Master three-dimensional viewing system. This technique provided a groundbreaking perception of depth and intricate detail, showcasing Dr. Bassett's pioneering work.

Collaborating with artists Ruth Ogren, Harriet Oâ€™Neill, and Lorene Segal, three artists translated the 1,547 photographic images into detailed line drawings. This collaboration resulted in the 24-volume "Stereoscopic Atlas of Human Anatomy," completed in 1962 after a seventeen-year effort. Following Dr. Bassett's passing, his images and working materials were generously donated to Stanford University by his widow, Lucille F. Bassett. These materials were utilized in revisions of the atlas and other projects with the permission of Lucille F. Bassett.
